### Project Information
Project vCover is a player for playing music using Youtube video.

### Features
Project vCover removed unnecessary features and codes from the existing Metube, made it lighter, and improved the wrong way of coding. Additionally, the newly added library synchronizes with your actual Youtube playlist.
Therefore, managing libraries in the Project vCover is the same as managing the actual Youtube library.
